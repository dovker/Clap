# Clap
Clap Game Framework

**Clap Framework** is a game framework marketed towards game developers that choose to develop games at a low-level with C++. It's main goal is to be as simple, flexible and clean as possible, while having great performance.

# Plan

Currently this framework is being developed to reach an Alpha ( Usable ) state, that would be feature complete enough to develop a 2D game and provide enough tools for one to comfortably write an advanced 3D renderer on top of it.

# Current Features
* OpenGL and SDL abstractions
* Custom ECS system
* Custom Event system and Event pools
* Sprite Batching
* Text (Rasterized and SDF) rendering

# Features currently being developed
* ImGui support
* Asset management and File system
* Project structuring and packaging
* Audio Support


# Future Features
* 3D Rendering functionalities
* Bindings to a scripting language
* Multithreading
