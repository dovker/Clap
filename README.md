# Clap
Clap Game Framework

**Clap Framework** is a game framework marketed towards game developers that choose to develop games at a low-level with C++. It's main goal is to be as simple, flexible and clean as possible, while having great performance.

# Plan

Currently this framework is being developed to reach an Alpha ( Usable ) state, that would be feature complete enough to develop a 2D game and provide enough tools for one to comfortably write an advanced 3D renderer on top of it.

# Design Philosophy

To be described.

# Current Features
* OpenGL 4.5 and SDL abstractions
* Custom ECS system
* Custom Event system and Event pools
* Sprite Batching
* Text (Rasterized, Sprite and SDF) rendering
* ImGui support

# Features currently being developed
* Asset management and File system
* Project structuring and packaging
* Audio Support
* Bindings to a scripting language ([Wren](https://wren.io))

# Future

The future vision is for **Clap** is a MonoGame-esque framework that exceeds in performance and simplicity while being cross-platform among Desktop Platforms, Mobile devices, Web (Not Decided yet), Consoles. This is a vision though. Platforms may change and the direction of Game Engines may switch. No Pun intended.

## Future Features
* Vulkan and MoltenVK support
* Shader Cross-Compilation
* 3D Rendering functionalities
* Multithreading
* Profiling Tools
* Documentation
